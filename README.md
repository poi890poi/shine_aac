# SHine INtegrated Expression: AAC for Communication Impairment
SHINE AAC is an affordable and versatile augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) solution designed for individuals with restricted motor functions.

# Background
> "Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease."

This project specially focuses on those with very limited motor functions. People with very limited motor functions cannot control their bodies with enough power, speed, or precision to operate any common input device including pens, touch panels, mouses, buttons, or AAC devices based on above input devices. These people have a wide range of types and degrees of impairments and require highly customized system to suit their conditions. For example, one might use eyelids to give signals while one might use fingers. And the bit depth (number of unique symbols) and throughput (symbols in a given time) are very limited. Our hands can easily output thousands of different symbols. But eyelids have only two states: open or closed. The device will be designed to take any types of input and output any symbols.

- The system should be affordable and operate with consumer devices including PCs, laptops, smartphones, or tablets.
- The system could include hardware devices or could be pure software (utilize common devices of a smartphone such as microphone, touch screen, or camera).
- The system mostly bases on [Switch Access Scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access_scanning) for its minimal requirement of motor capabilities.
- The system must have a customizable input: device, mode of operation, number of states (signals), expected throughput (signals per minute).
- The system must have a customizable output: number of symbols and each symbol could be cusomized.
